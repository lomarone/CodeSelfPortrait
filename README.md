# SelfPortrait
Display a self-portrait made out of simple shapes.

## Software Design
This project includes the basics of processing including int variables, color variables, setup function, draw function, and drawing shapes. The shapes I used were rectangles, ellipses, arcs, and triangles. I also used the rotate function to be able to rotate shapes to a varying degree when I needed to. There was no interactive portion to this assignment, so the code that was written produces a static drawing rather than one a user is able to manipulate or interact with. By sectioning and placing the snippets of code where I want them in the processing file, I was able to create multiple layers giving my drawing a more well rounded look. 

## Reflections
I felt that most of my drawing was able to be translated well into processing. The only things I was not able to do were the teeth and some specific line details. I am particularly proud of how the hair turned out in my processing sketch because I think it has a very similar shape to my hair in the physical sketch I drew. The process was quite enjoyable to me until I got to the arcs. I was figuring them out as I went, as I did not have previous experience using arcs, and I found it difficult to figure out where the arc would display according to PI. I also ran into some difficulty while trying to rotate the arcs because I could only see part of the "invisible" ellipse that the arc is following so when I would rotate it, the arc would suddenly fly to the other side of the screen. Eventually, I got the hang of it. Overall, I had a lot of fun doing this project!
